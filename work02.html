              We presented the project idea at 2024 UM Robotics Undergraduate Symposium and are still working on it. So
              far, we have built several firefly-bot prototypes and implemented the synchronization algorithm. We are
              now redesigning the PCB for scalability and preparing for a public exhibition of the firefly wall.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The very nature of this project combines themes in biology, engineering, and art. Swarms of insects,
              like
              fireflies are naturally evolved multi-agent systems that coordinate their behaviors in ways that are
              both
              functionally significant and visually interesting. Inspired by the rhythmic flashing of fireflies, we
              are
              building a swarm of analog firefly robots to mimic their self-synchronization behavior by developing
              customized digital communication protocols. We plan to study their potential to invoke positive emotions
              in
              a viewer and improve humans’ emotional states through our interactive installation.

            <h2>Background: Bio-Inspired Synchronization</h2>
            <p>Naturally evolved multi-agent systems - like flocks of birds, schools of fish, and swarms of insects –
              coordinate their behaviors that are both functionally significant and visually interesting. Inspired by
              the
              rhythmic flashing of fireflies, we are building a swarm of analog firefly robots to mimic their
              self-synchronization behavior and study their potential to invoke positive emotions in a viewer and
              improve
              humans' emotional states through interactive art displays and installations. </p>
            <p>Prior research in the field indicates that breathing lights have a calming effect on emotional states; We
              aim to extend this paradigm beyond observation and invite interaction. This poster presents initial
              progress
              towards building an interactive wall of self-synchronizing fireflies that also respond to the passage of
              people walking nearby. In addition to visual cues, we also plan to experiment with generating sounds that
              represent the state of the synchronization event, initially discordant tones that eventually harmonize
              along
              with the fireflies as they self-synchronize. creating a soothing experience for people who interact with
              the
              demonstration.</p>

            <h2>Digitized Synchronization</h2>
            <h3>Firefly Behavior</h3>
            <p> Our work depends on the digital implementation of synchronization behaviors observed in nature. The
              table
              below depicts two bio-inspired self synchronization algorithms and the accompanying electronic processes
              our
              robots use to implement them.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h3>Phase-delay Model </h3>
        <p>The phase-delay model is one of many proposed by John and Elisabeth Buck based on their observations of how
          different fireflies behave in their natural habitats. In this model, the firefly resets its internal counter
          whenever an external stimulus is detected. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h3>Integrate-and-fire Model</h3>
        <p>Louis Lapicque was a French biologist who introduced the Integrate-and-fire model in 1907, which was later
          applied to describe neuronal activity in the 1970s. An integrate-and-fire oscillator adds to an internal
          function until some threshold value is reached when the system "fires" and resets. This model is commonly
          used to describe similar phenomenon in our brain, where the firing of each neuron is stochastically driven
          by the excitation of other individual neurons by the same integrate-and-fire model, causing a chain effect
          that ultimately results in brain activity on the macroscopic scale.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>Our robots emulate the natural flashing period of a firefly by constantly advancing an internal counter and
          using it to time its own flash cycles. When the flash of a nearby firefly is detected, the bots make
          adjustments to the state of this counter according to the synchronization model implemented. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h2>Firefly-bot Communication</h2>
        <h3>Pulse-width Modulated Synchronization Signal</h3>
        <p>We implemented infrared (IR) based communications between firefly robots instead of the visual cues that
          actual fireflies use for signaling each other. This allows for more robust and reliable communications that
          are not sensitive to changing ambient lighting conditions and interfering IR sources like reflections or
          sunlight.
          Each firefly bot is equipped with an IR LED for transmissions and an IR receiver tuned to a 38kHz carrier,
          enabling them to exchange serially encoded binary numbers that can be used for identification and basic
          instructions. </p>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
        <h3>Proposed Audience Interaction Scheme</h3>
        <p>We envision an installation where a swarm of fireflies are mounted on a vertical surface that loosely
          represents 'pixels' on the display. A camera-based system will detect people approaching the display and
          allow them to interact with the swarm by affecting the firefly robots through a combination of gesture and
          proximity cues. The relevant Fireflies might be activated, reset or phase-advanced by these cues and
          allowing the user to initiate or affect a synchronization event. </p>

        <h2>Current Progress</h2>
        <h3>Synchronizing RP2040 firefly bots</h3>
        <p>We have developed new firefly bots on RP2040 microcontroller that are backwards-compatible with the
          previous-generation of UMD FIREfly bots while keeping the IR-communications protocol easily expandable to
          support interactive elements. The current bots transmit IR-signals and flash visible LEDs at regular
          intervals, detect IR signals from neighboring units, and implement synchronization algorithms. </p>

        <h3>Motion Detection in MATLAB </h3>
        <p>We have implemented a camera-based interactive algorithm in Matlab that detects and maps motion in the
          captured image plane to trigger signals for firefly bots in specific zones of the display. This serves as a
          basis and proof of concept for the unit-based approach we will implement with the fireflies.</p>

        <h2>Onging Development</h2>
        <h3>Firefly Wall</h3>
        <p>We are currently designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) based on our prototypes in order to streamline the
          process of producing the large number of fireflies needed to create our swarm. We plan to mount them on a
          large vertical surface to create a wall of fireflies. The display will serve both as an art installation and
          an experimental tool that allows us to survey people who interact with it to assess the emotional impact of
          interacting with the swarm.</p>
        <h3>Educational Module</h3>
        <p>This will allow us to continue the educational mission of the UMD FIREfly robots by developing instructional
          material around the firefly system and offering them as a kit. A standardized PCB design will enable quick and
          easy assembly that would be beneficial in a classroom environment, allowing the firefly bots to serve as a
          hands-on learning tool exploring electronic circuits, software and biological phenomena. </p>
