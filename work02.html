            </div>
            <p>The Firefly Robot project originated from Dr. Derrick Yeo's work at the University of Maryland. Rishad Hasan and I joined the project through ROB 203: Robot Mechanism at the University of Michigan, Fall 2024. We presented the project idea at 2024 UM Robotics Undergraduate Symposium and are still working on it. So far, we have built several firefly-bot prototypes and implemented the synchronization algorithm. We are now redesigned the PCB for scalability and preparing for a public exhibition of the firefly wall.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Naturally evolved multi-agent systems - like flocks of birds, schools of fish, and swarms of insects –
            coordinate their behaviors that are both functionally significant and visually interesting. Inspired by the
            rhythmic flashing of fireflies, we are building a swarm of analog firefly robots to mimic their
            self-synchronization behavior and study their potential to invoke positive emotions in a viewer and improve
            humans’ emotional states through interactive art displays and installations. </p>
          <p>Prior research in the field indicates that breathing lights have a calming effect on emotional states; We
            aim to extend this paradigm beyond observation and invite interaction. This poster presents initial progress
            towards building an interactive wall of self-synchronizing fireflies that also respond to the passage of
            people walking nearby. In addition to visual cues, we also plan to experiment with generating sounds that
            represent the state of the synchronization event, initially discordant tones that eventually harmonize along
            with the fireflies as they self-synchronize. creating a soothing experience for people who interact with the
            demonstration.</p>

          <h2>Digitized Synchronization</h2>
          <h3>Firefly Behavior</h3>
          <p> Our work depends on the digital implementation of synchronization behaviors observed in nature. The table
            below depicts two bio-inspired self synchronization algorithms and the accompanying electronic processes our
            robots use to implement them.</p>

        <h3>In the context of firefly synchronization, we combine the following two algorithm on our robots by
          incrementing the internal counter each cycle when an external stimulus is detected, causing each agent to
          advance its period for that cycle.</h3>
      </div> -->

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h3>Phase-delay Model </h3>
        <p>The phase-delay model is one of many proposed by John and Elisabeth Buck based on their observations of how
          different fireflies behave in their natural habitats. In this model, the firefly resets its internal counter
          whenever an external stimulus is detected. </p>

        <h3>Integrate-and-fire Model</h3>
        <p>Louis Lapicque was a French biologist who introduced the Integrate-and-fire model in 1907, which was later
          applied to describe neuronal activity in the 1970s. An integrate-and-fire oscillator adds to an internal
          function until some threshold value is reached when the system "fires" and resets. This model is commonly
          used to describe similar phenomenon in our brain, where the firing of each neuron is stochastically driven
          by the excitation of other individual neurons by the same integrate-and-fire model, causing a chain effect
          that ultimately results in brain activity on the macroscopic scale.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>Our robots emulate the natural flashing period of a firefly by constantly advancing an internal counter and
          using it to time its own flash cycles. When the flash of a nearby firefly is detected, the bots make
          adjustments to the state of this counter according to the synchronization model implemented. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h2>Firefly-bot Communication</h2>
        <h3>Pulse-width Modulated Synchronization Signal</h3>
        <p>We implemented infrared (IR) based communications between firefly robots instead of the visual cues that
          actual fireflies use for signaling each other. This allows for more robust and reliable communications that
          are not sensitive to changing ambient lighting conditions and interfering IR sources like reflections or
          sunlight.
          Each firefly bot is equipped with an IR LED for transmissions and an IR receiver tuned to a 38kHz carrier,
          enabling them to exchange serially encoded binary numbers that can be used for identification and basic
          instructions. </p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">
          <h3>Proposed Audience Interaction Scheme</h3>
          <p>We envision an installation where a swarm of fireflies are mounted on a vertical surface that loosely
            represents ‘pixels’ on the display. A camera-based system will detect people approaching the display and
            allow them to interact with the swarm by affecting the firefly robots through a combination of gesture and
            proximity cues. The relevant Fireflies might be activated, reset or phase-advanced by these cues and
            allowing the user to initiate or affect a synchronization event. </p>

          <p>Four <b>ultrasonic distance sensors</b> are equipped on the frame, facing each direction to detect
            whether there is audience approaching, and the speed of approaching. When approached, the fruit dodges to
            the opposite direction to an extent based on the spped of audience. If there is someone nearby without
            approaching, the fruit raises her head to the audience curiously.</p>
          <h3>Touch</h3>

          <p>Multiple <b>pressure sensors</b> and <b>flex sensors</b> are attached to the surface of the fruit,
            monitoring the force applied on it. The fruit swings and trembles when being touched as if their scars are
            touched. <b>What kind of scars? A strong desire to be cared not only physically, but emotionally. A strong
              desire to lead a decent late time.</b> The trembling reflects their struggle in the caregiver
            relationship: having no choice but to depend on; having no autonomy but desiring love.</p>
