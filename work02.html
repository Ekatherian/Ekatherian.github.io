          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Naturally evolved multi-agent systems - like flocks of birds, schools of fish, and swarms of insects –
            coordinate their behaviors that are both functionally significant and visually interesting. Inspired by the
            rhythmic flashing of fireflies, we are building a swarm of analog firefly robots to mimic their
            self-synchronization behavior and study their potential to invoke positive emotions in a viewer and improve
            humans’ emotional states through interactive art displays and installations. </p>
          <p>Prior research in the field indicates that breathing lights have a calming effect on emotional states; We
            aim to extend this paradigm beyond observation and invite interaction. This poster presents initial progress
            towards building an interactive wall of self-synchronizing fireflies that also respond to the passage of
            people walking nearby. In addition to visual cues, we also plan to experiment with generating sounds that
            represent the state of the synchronization event, initially discordant tones that eventually harmonize along
            with the fireflies as they self-synchronize. creating a soothing experience for people who interact with the
            demonstration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-xs-12">
          <h2>Digitized Synchronization</h2>
          <p> Our work depends on the digital implementation of synchronization behaviors observed in nature. The table
            below depicts two bio-inspired self synchronization algorithms and the accompanying electronic processes our
            robots use to implement them.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>In the context of firefly synchronization, we combine the following two algorithm on our robots by
          incrementing the internal counter each cycle when an external stimulus is detected, causing each agent to
          advance its period for that cycle.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h3>Phase-delay Model </h3>
        <p>The phase-delay model is one of many proposed by John and Elisabeth Buck based on their observations of how
          different fireflies behave in their natural habitats. In this model, the firefly resets its internal counter
          whenever an external stimulus is detected. </p>

        <h3>Integrate-and-fire Model</h3>
        <p>Louis Lapicque was a French biologist who introduced the Integrate-and-fire model in 1907, which was later
          applied to describe neuronal activity in the 1970s. An integrate-and-fire oscillator adds to an internal
          function until some threshold value is reached when the system "fires" and resets. This model is commonly
          used to describe similar phenomenon in our brain, where the firing of each neuron is stochastically driven
          by the excitation of other individual neurons by the same integrate-and-fire model, causing a chain effect
          that ultimately results in brain activity on the macroscopic scale.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <p>Our robots emulate the natural flashing period of a firefly by constantly advancing an internal counter and
          using it to time its own flash cycles. When the flash of a nearby firefly is detected, the bots make
          adjustments to the state of this counter according to the synchronization model implemented. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h2>Firefly-bot Communication</h2>
        <h3>Pulse-width Modulated Synchronization Signal</h3>
        <p>We implemented infrared (IR) based communications between firefly robots instead of the visual cues that
          actual fireflies use for signaling each other. This allows for more robust and reliable communications that
          are not sensitive to changing ambient lighting conditions and interfering IR sources like reflections or
          sunlight.
          Each firefly bot is equipped with an IR LED for transmissions and an IR receiver tuned to a 38kHz carrier,
          enabling them to exchange serially encoded binary numbers that can be used for identification and basic
          instructions. </p>

          <h3>Proposed Audience Interaction Scheme</h3>
          <p>We envision an installation where a swarm of fireflies are mounted on a vertical surface that loosely
            represents ‘pixels’ on the display. A camera-based system will detect people approaching the display and
            allow them to interact with the swarm by affecting the firefly robots through a combination of gesture and
            proximity cues. The relevant Fireflies might be activated, reset or phase-advanced by these cues and
            allowing the user to initiate or affect a synchronization event. </p>

              desire to lead a decent late time.</b> The trembling reflects their struggle in the caregiver

        <h2>Story Behind</h2>
        <p>My great-grandmother passed away when I was in my senior year of high school. For the first 18 years of my
          life, I thought she was my biological great-grandmother, my grandmother's mother. It wasn't until a casual
          family conversation that I learned the truth. My grandmother's birth mother had passed away when she was
          very young. My great-grandfather later married my great-grandmother, who raised three children that weren't
          her own. She never had biological children herself.</p>
        <p>In my memory, she was a kind, petite elderly woman. During Lunar New Year, she would call me by my nickname
          in her dialect and press red envelopes with money into my hands. Inside, there were coins and small bills of
          one yuan and five yuan. My sister and I would count them, and I’d find my sister’s total was a bit higher
          than mine.</p>
        <p>My great-grandfather and great-grandmother lived in a tiny apartment in the city center. At the entrance to
          their neighborhood, there were vendors selling cheap but delicious fruit and all kinds of snacks. After my
          great-grandfather passed away in his 80s, my great-grandmother moved into a nursing home. I later heard she
          didn’t get along with the cultured woman she shared a room with, so she was moved to another room.</p>
        <p>Sometimes we visited her. I would help her into a wheelchair and push her through the long corridors of the
          nursing home, then into the elevator, and up to the rooftop garden. There, I pushed her wheelchair in slow,
          steady circles. I can no longer remember what we talked about.</p>
        <p>The wheelchair went round and round until a nurse came by. The nurse greeted her and pointed at me, asking,
          “Who is she? She looks so much like you.” We told her I was her great-granddaughter. Not long before this, I
          had learned she wasn’t biologically related to me. I don’t know what she thought when she heard that
          question. Shortly after, she passed away.</p>
        <p>In the Ndebele tribe of Africa, people believe that if a family member dies far from home, the fruit of a
          Kigelia (Sausage Tree) is buried where the body lies. They also believe the tree can heal illnesses and
          drive away evil spirits.</p>
        <p>I never heard my great-grandmother talk about her friends or family. No one else in the family ever
          mentioned them either. During her decades with my great-grandfather, her sense of self seemed to be wholly
          absorbed into her role in this family. Yet, I could still sense a kind of distance from some family members.
          She was someone who passed away far from her “home”, whether that “home” was this family or her own. She
          deserved a Sausage Tree, growing in some faraway desert.</p>
        <p>In my family, women who marry into the family from far away play an essential role. They bring vitality,
          sometimes gentle, sometimes fierce, to this family. They give it life and energy. But more importantly, they
          are lively, lovable, memorable, and a little stubborn. I want to show you the shape of their lives. Or
          rather, I want you to see, through the growth and breaking of this fruit, the form of life it holds within.
